# UE5_RPG
RPG game made in Unreal Engine 5

My aim here is to have some practice with EU5, play with new tools and possibly make a foundation for more serious project in the futue.

Why RPG? It usually include many subsystems like elemental demage with rock-paper-scisors rules as well as loot system and many other making it more challanging (and fun) to implement.

Plans for the future? I would like it to be a project I'll work on in my free time and one day get big and entertaining enough to release it.
