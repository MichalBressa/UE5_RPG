# UE5_RPG
RPG game made in Unreal Engine 5

My aim here is to have some practice with EU5, play with new tools and possibly make a foundation for more serious project in the futue.

Why RPG? It usually include many subsystems like elemental demage with rock-paper-scisors rules as well as loot system and many other making it more challanging (and fun) to implement.

Plans for the future? I would like it to be a project I'll work on in my free time and one day get big and entertaining enough to release it.

As on 12.10.2023
Today I finished vaulting using motion wraping. Character is now able to vault over obstacles like crates or small walls. In the future parcour system will be expanded to include more sufraces and moves.
The video below shows results and some blueprints (sorry I had to decrease quality so that it can be uploaded to github).
